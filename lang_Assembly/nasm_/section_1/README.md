# Assembly Programming Language

## Beginner Level
1. Introduction to Assembly Language
  - What is Assembly?
  - Role of Assemblers (NASM, MASM, GAS, FASM)
  - Relationship between Assembly and Machine Code
  - Assembly vs. High-level Language
2. CPU Architecture Basics
  - x86-64 Architecture Overview
  - Registers (General Purpose, Special Purpose, Segment and Flags)
  - Memory Segments (Code, Data, Stack, Heap)
  - Endiannes (Little-endian vs. Big-endian)
3. Basic Assembly Syntax
  - Writing and Compiling Assembly Code
  - Directives (.text, .data, .bss)
  - Labels, Instructions, and Comments
  - Basic Data Types (Bytes, Words, Double Words, Quad Words)
4. Basic Instruction and Addressing Modes
  - `mov`, `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`
  - Immediate, Register, Direct, and Indirect Addressing
  - Working with Constants and Variables
5. Stack and Function Calls
  - `push` and `pop` Instructions
  - Calling Conventions (System V for Linux, stdcall for windows)
  - Function Prologues and Epilogues
  - Calling C Functions from Assembly
6. Basic Input/Output
