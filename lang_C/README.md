# C Programming Language

## 1. Basic of C Programming

### 1.1 Introduction to C
  - History and features of C
  - Setting up a C environment (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
  - Writing and compiling a basic "Hello, World!" program
### 1.2 Basic Syntax and Data Types
  - Keywords and identifiers
  - Variables and constants
  - Data types (`int`, `float`, `char`, `double`)
  - Input and output (`printf`, `scanf`)
### 1.3 Operators and Expressions
  - Arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, and assignment operators
  - Operator precedence and associativity
### 1.4 Control Flow Statements
  - Conditional statements (`if`,`if-else`, nested `if`)
  - Switch-case statement
### 1.5 Loops and Iterations
  - `for`, `while`, `do-while` loops
  - Break and `continue` statements
  - Nested loops

## 2. Intermediate C Concepts

### 2.1 Functions
  - Defining and calling functions
  - Function parameters and return values
  - Function prototypes ans recursion
  - Variabl scope (global, local, static, extern)
### 2.2 Arrays and Strings
  - One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays
  - String handling (`strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strcmp`)
  - Character array vs. string literals
### 2.3 Pointers
  - Basics of pointers
  - Pointer arithmetic
  - Pointers and arrays
  - Pointers and strings
  - Pointers and functions
  - Pointers to pointers
  - Memory addresses and pointer manipulation
### 2.4 Dynamic Memory Allocation
  - `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`
  - Memory leaks and handling
### 2.5 Structures and Unions
  - Defining and using structures
  - Nested structures
  - Structures and pointers
  - Unions and differences from structures
### 2.5 File Handling
  - file pointer (FILE*)
  - file operation (`fopen`, `fclose`, `fread`, `fwrite`, `fprintf`,
    `fscanf`)
  - Binary vs. text files
  - Error handling in file operations

## 3. Advanced C Programming

### 3.1 Preprocessor Directives
  - Macros and #define
  - Conditional compilation (`#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#endif`)
  - Include guards and header files
### 3.2 Advanced Pointer Concepts
  - Pointer to functions and callbacks
  - Dynamic arrays using pointers
  - Function pointer and `vtable` (virtual tables in C)
### 3.3 Multi-file Programming
  - Header files and modular programming
  - Compilation and linking process
### 3.4 Data Structures in C
  - Linked List (Single, Double, Circular)
  - Stacks Queues (Implementation using arrays and linked lists)
  - Hash Tables
  - Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs)
  - Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)
### 3.5 Advanced Memory Management
  - Memory alignment and padding
  - Stack vs. Heap memory
  - Segmentation faults and debugging

## 4. Mastry Level

### 4.1 Low-level Programming
  - System calls and kernel interactions
  - Inline Assembly with C
  - Bit manipulation and embedded systems
  - Hardware interactions (memory-mapped I/O)
### 4.2 Concurrency and Multi-threading
  - Processes vs. threads
  - POSIX threads (`pthreads`)
  - Synchronization (`mutexes`, `semaphores`)
### 4.3 Interfacing with Other Languages
  - C with Assembly
  - C with Python (Cython, ctypes)
  - C with C++ (extern "C")
### 4.4 Debugging and Performance Optimization
  - Debugging with GDB
  - Profiling with Valgrind and gprof
  - Compiler optimizations (01, 02, 03, 0fast)
### 4.5 Writing Secure Code
  - Buffer overflows and how to prevent them
  - Secure coding practices (bounds checking, stack canaries)
  - Secure file handling and input validation

## 5. Projects and Real-World Applications
  - Writing a simple shell in C
  - Implementing a basic HTTP server
  - Developing a small database system
  - Creating an OS kernel (simple bootloader)
